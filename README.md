# Garmin Varia Rack Mount

A simple rear rack mount for the Garmin Varia radar taillight.

The design is based on
[Mhouser13's mount](https://www.printables.com/model/48649-garmin-varia-bike-rack-mount), but with the Garmin mount
point shifted higher up to provide more tire clearance.

The offset height can be adjusted to some degree in FreeCAD by adjusting the "Mount Offset" value within the contained
spreadsheet.  Only the default offset has been tested.
